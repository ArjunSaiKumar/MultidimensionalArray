(n-dimensional array) library for C# targeting .Net 6.0

      Core features:
        - n-dimensional arrays (tensors) in host memory or on CUDA GPUs 
        - element-wise operations (addition, multiplication, absolute value, etc.)
        - reduction operations (sum, product, average, maximum, arg max, etc.)
        - logic operations (comparision, and, or, etc.)
        - views, slicing, reshaping, broadcasting (similar to NumPy) 
        - scatter and gather by indices
